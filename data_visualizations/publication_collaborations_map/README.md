# Data Visualizations

The code and ideas here are part of the experimental data visualizations that have been part of the explorations done in the library with a variety of data and for a number of different purposes.

| Visualization | Purpose | When |
|---------------|---------|------|
|Putting [countries on a map with publication counts](./implementation_note.ipynb) in Python.  The interactive [nbviewer version](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NCAR/NCAR_library_experimental/blob/collaborationmaps/data_visualizations/publication_collaborations_map/implementation_note.ipynb) seems to show the full features best.| A quick implementation of mapping countries and their publication counts.  **INPUT:** a set of countries and the collaboration counts of the number of times that country has an author collaborating with an NCAR author; **OUTPUT:** maps.| Sep 2016 |
